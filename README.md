# Wikipedia Random Walk Explorer

Interactive client-side visualiser that performs a random walk across Wikipedia.

## Getting Started

- Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox).
- Enter a starting page title (e.g., `Alan Turing`) and click **Start**.
- Pause, resume, or single-step the walk using the sidebar controls.
- Use the **Node Size Multiplier** slider to scale node radii up to 10×.

## How It Works

- Sidebar stats track furthest hop distance from the seed and counts of walk/similarity edges alongside step totals.

All requests are made directly from the browser; no backend server is required.
